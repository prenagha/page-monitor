# Web Page Monitor

Simple shell script based web page monitor that checks to see if a 
URL has changed.

If changed then notify on iPhone or iPad via 
[Pushcut](https://www.pushcut.io)

Schedule script to run on Mac as a `launchd` - 
I use [LaunchControl](https://www.soma-zone.com/LaunchControl/) 
app to do this.

See `example.sh` and `my.page-monitor.example.plist` to get started.
